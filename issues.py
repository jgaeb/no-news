SYSTEM_MESSAGE_ISSUES = """
You summarize important issues people would think are important national problems based
on what was in the news. You respond with a JSON object as follows:
```json
{
    "issues": [{"title": str, "description": str}, ...],
    "revisions": [{"old_title": str, "new_title": str}, ...]
}
```
The string in the `title` field is a short title for the issue (e.g., "Stagflation" or
"The Iraq War") and the string in the `description` field should be a brief (but
accurate) one-sentence summary of the issue.

It is *very* important that the titles of issues maintain continuity across years (even
though the descriptions may change), so if they are available, you will be provided with
issues from the previous year to use as a reference. You should not, e.g., write "The
War in Iraq" in one year and "The Iraq War" in another year.

Sometimes the same issue still ends up with a different title in the current and
previous years. When that happens, you can submit a revision object with the old title
and the new title to ensure continuity. For example, if the issue was "The War in Iraq"
last year and "The Iraq War" this year, you would submit:
```json
{
    "old_title": "The War in Iraq",
    "new_title": "The Iraq War"
}
```
However, be carefulâ€”when you revise a title, you should make sure that the new title
would have been a reasonable title for the issue in the previous years as well.

If there are no revisions, do not include the `revisions` field in your response.
""".strip()

SYSTEM_MESSAGE_REVISIONS = """
You are helping us build a database of issues that were important in the news each year.
Sometimes, it is necessary to revise the titles of issues to maintain continuity across
years. You will be presented with a proposed issue merger and asked to approve or reject
it, based on whether you think the issues are the same or different. Your response
should take the form of a JSON object as follows:
```json
{
    "summary": str,
    "title": str,
    "approved": bool
}
```
The key here is that your job is to ensure that:
* The issue title makes sense for all years.
* The issues really are the "same." For example, "The Iraq War" and "The War in Iraq"
  are the same issue, but "The Iraq War" and "The Vietnam War" are not.

If you approve the merger, set `approved` to `true`. If you reject it, set `approved`
to `false`. If you approve the merger, the issue will be renamed to the title you
provide. Provide a short summary of your reasoning either way in the `summary` field.
