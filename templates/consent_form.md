## Key Information 	

The following is a short summary of this study to help you decide whether to be
a part of this study. More detailed information is listed later in this form. 

<br>
### Why am I being invited to take part in a research study? 

We invite you to take part in a research study led by Harvard University
researchers because you are an adult (18+), an English speaker, and located in
the US.

<br>
### What should I know about a research study? 

* Someone will explain this research study to you.
* Whether or not you take part is up to you.
* Your participation is completely voluntary.
* You can choose not to take part.
* You can agree to take part and later change your mind.
* Your decision will not be held against you.  
* Your refusal to participate will not result in any consequences or any loss
  of benefits that you are otherwise entitled to receive.
* You can ask all the questions you want before you decide.

<br>
### Why is this research being done? 

This research validates a new method for analyzing television news content
using artificial intelligence. We want to compare how accurately large language
models classify news segments compared to human annotators like yourself. This
will help us understand the reliability of automated approaches for studying
media content.
 
<br>
### How long will the research last and what will I need to do? 

We expect that you will be in this research study for approximately
{{minutes_per_task}} minutes. You will be asked to read brief summaries of
television news segments and classify them by topic and type through an online
survey. 

<br>
### Is there any way being in this study could be bad for me? 

We don’t believe there are any risks from participating in this research. 

<br>
### Will being in this study help me in any way? 

There are no benefits to you from your taking part in this research. We cannot
promise any benefits to others from your taking part in this research. However,
possible benefits to others include advancing our understanding of media
content analysis methods and contributing to research on how news coverage has
changed over time.

<br>
### What happens if I do not want to be in this research?

Participation in research is completely voluntary. You can decide to
participate, not participate, or discontinue participation at any time without
penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.

<br>
Your alternative to participating in this research study is to not participate.

<br>
## Detailed Information 	

The following is more detailed information about this study in addition to the
information listed above. 

<br>
### What is the purpose of this research?

This study validates a novel classification method for analyzing television
news content using large language models (LLMs). We have developed an automated
system to categorize news segments from major broadcast networks spanning
1968-2019. To ensure the accuracy and reliability of this automated approach,
we need to compare its performance against human judgment. Your participation
will help us determine how well artificial intelligence performs compared to
human experts at classifying news content.

<br>
### How long will I take part in this research?

You will participate in a single online session lasting approximately
{{minutes_per_task}} minutes.

<br>
### What happens if I say yes, I want to be in this research?

If you agree to participate, you will:

* Complete an online survey through the Qualtrics platform
* Review brief instructions
* Read and classify {{segments_per_participant}} news segment abstracts (brief
  summaries of television news stories)
* The entire process will be completed online at your convenience
* You will interact only with the online survey platform. No other people are
  involved, nor will AI tools be used.
