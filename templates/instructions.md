## Instructions

You will be asked to read brief abstracts of television news segments and
classify them:

1. Into "hard news" (e.g., politics, economics, crime) or "soft news" (e.g.,
   entertainment, sports, human interest).
2. Into broad "topic" categories (e.g., "Military and Defense", "Health and
   Medical Advances", etc.).
3. According to important "issues" (e.g., "Unemployment", "Clinton
   Impeachment") from the year the segment was originally broadcasted.

Some segments may fit into multiple categories. If so, you may choose both a
primary category, which you think best describes the segment, and a secondary
category. If _no_ category fits, you may choose "No topic fits this abstract."

Please read each abstract carefully.
